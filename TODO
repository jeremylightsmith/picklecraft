[x] create a block at an x,y,z coordinate through the server

Story: cage all mobs w/in 20 blocks w/ ice blocks
  [ ] receive slash command
  [ ] know where mobs are w/in 20 blocks
  [ ] know where the ground is w/in 20 blocks (nice to have)

[ ] receive /event executed
[ ] stop server when world shuts down
[ ] should we be using gRPC?
